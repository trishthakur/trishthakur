Hi, I’m **Trishala Thakur**,

I am a Data Scientist with ~ 4 years of experience building machine learning models and AI systems that drive impact for a wide range of stakeholders. My work spans deep learning, research automation, and scalable ML applications, helping organizations and researchers make faster, smarter decisions.

I build machine learning systems that turn complex data into production-ready solutions, driving measurable impact in research automation, operational reliability, and predictive analytics.

In my current role, I develop AI pipelines processing 1TB+ of image and text data. I built a multi-agent system to automate face–name matching, leveraged LLMs to extract structured insights from scientific literature, and trained CNNs for fine-grained classification, enabling researchers to analyze massive datasets efficiently.

A snapshot of the tools and techniques I work with regularly

Python | R | NumPy | pandas | PyTorch | TensorFlow | HuggingFace | scikit-learn | SciPy | OpenCV | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Plotly | LLMs | RAG | Convolutional Neural Networks  XGBoost | Google Cloud Platform | HPC | APIs | Git | SQL | Linux
